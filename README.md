# FoxScript4
A simple way to create datapacks. Create loops, conditions, advanced math with a foolproof scripting language. Notice when a player interacts with something, when a player joins, and when a player dies. Create visually sophisticated user interfaces that go beyond a normal interface. Use decimal numbers.
Foxscript 4 is the new generation of datapack tools. Write -mcfunction files as usual - but with a twist. Foxscript adds many interesting features. Execute functions on different events - not only tick & load. Write mathematical equations as usual and Foxscript will compile them too.
